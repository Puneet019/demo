 * Switch Statements :``` switch``` statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed. Each value is called a ```case```, and the variable being switched on is checked for each case.

      When the variable being switched on is equal to a case, the statements following that case will execute until a break statement is reached.
 
   A ```switch statement``` can have an optional default case, which must appear at the end of the switch
* Synatax : 
```bash
switch(expression) {
            case a:
             // code
              break;
              case b:
             // code 
               break;
            default:
             // code 
             }
```
