# Readme 

In this code, cout is used to output (print) values and cin is to get user input.
``` cin``` is a predefined variable that reads data from the keyboard with the extraction operator (>>).

*  NOTE :- ```cout``` is pronounced ``` "see-out"``` and uses the insertion operator (<<).


         ```cin``` is pronounced ```"see-in"``` and uses the extraction operator (>>).
