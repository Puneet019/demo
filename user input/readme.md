 In this code, cout is used to output (print) values and cin is to get user input.
 cin is a predefined variable that reads data from the keyboard with the extraction operator (>>).

 NOTE :- cout is pronounced "see-out" and uses the insertion operator (<<).
         cin is pronounced "see-in" and uses the extraction operator (>>).
